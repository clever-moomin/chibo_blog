I recently moved to the Yokohama area because of all the remote work.

Some days I'm having a great time, but there are a few things that I find inconvenient because I'm used to living in Tokyo, so I'll try to summarize those.

I also feel that most of the people who send out "Let's spend time in the suburbs" are not people who work for regular companies or have a general freelance work style.

I think it's a very rare pattern for those people to make a living with the style they are transmitting, so I'm going to try to write about it for the universal remote worker (including those who are likely to work that way in the future due to Corona's influence + company policy).
